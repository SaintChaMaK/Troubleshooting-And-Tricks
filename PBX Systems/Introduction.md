**PBX**, short for **Private Branch Exchange**, is a private telephone network used within a business or organization to manage internal and external communications.  It enables employees to communicate internally via extensions and route external calls through the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or over the internet using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). Originally developed in the 1960s as a manual switchboard system, modern PBX systems are automated and often cloud-based, offering advanced features like call routing, voicemail, conferencing, interactive voice response (IVR), and integration with CRM tools.
