Tailscale is a secure, zero-config mesh VPN (Virtual Private Network) service that creates a private, encrypted network—called a "tailnet"—between your devices, regardless of their location or network. Built on the WireGuard protocol, Tailscale enables direct, peer-to-peer connections between devices (like laptops, phones, servers, and IoT devices) without requiring port forwarding, complex firewall rules, or a central gateway. It uses identity-based access control and a zero-trust security model, ensuring only authorized devices can communicate. Tailscale is cross-platform, supports both personal and enterprise use, and is free for up to 3 users and 100 devices. It’s widely used for remote access, site-to-site networking, cloud connectivity, and securing distributed teams.
